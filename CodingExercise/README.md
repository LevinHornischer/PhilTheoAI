# Coding Exercise Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to build an AI model---step by step and without any coding skills required---in order to get an idea what this process looks like.

The easiest (and very common) way to open the exercise and be able to run the code in it (without install anything) is to do it online here:

But if you want to avoid using Google, you can download the jupyter notebook which contains the exercise (i.e., the file [`phil-theo-ai_coding.ipynb`](phil-theo-ai_coding.ipynb)) and open it in any other way that you prefer. 
For example, you can open it in a code editor on your computer (where you have Python installed) like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
You can use the file [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) to see exactly the packages and their versions which I used.
