Welcome to the course _Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence_! It is given during the winter semester 2025/26 at _LMU Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. (Past editions: winter 2023/24, winter 2024/25.)

# Motivation 

Despite the tremendous technological progress of modern artificial intelligence, we are still lacking a thorough theoretical understanding of it. The situation is sometimes compared to technologies in the past: that the artifact (e.g., the steam engine) came first and the theory (thermodynamics) later. In this course, we start with an introduction to deep learning and then discuss both classic and recent literature from the philosophy and theory of AI. In terms of content, the aim is to thus get an introduction to the current understanding of the foundations of AI, including the key open questions. In terms of skill, the aim is to learn to mathematically develop and philosophically assess the different approaches.

# General information

We have one session per week during the semester:

1. The _lecture_ given by me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html), on Wednesdays from 12:15 to 13:45 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31). Below you find a schedule of when we cover which topic. 


# Lecture Notes

The lecture notes are updated as the course progresses. You find the latest edition here: [`phil-theo-ai.pdf`](phil-theo-ai.pdf).


# Coding Exercise

To philosophize and theorize about AI models, it is—I think—essential to also practically see one. This is what this exercise is for: to build an AI model step by step and without any coding experience required. It also show-cases the 'machine learning pipeline': from task conceptualization to deployment of the trained model.

The easiest (and very common) way to open the exercise and be able to run the code in it (without install anything) is to do it online here:

But if you want to do this locally on your computer (which is more advanced), you find all the necessary material in [this github repository](https://github.com/LevinHornischer/PhilTheoAI/tree/main/CodingExercise).
